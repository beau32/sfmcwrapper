# SFMC API Wrapper
ET_Client is a lightweight, Python-based client library for interacting with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) SOAP and REST APIs. This library is built with modern tools like zeep for SOAP and requests for REST, replacing legacy FuelSDK implementations with a cleaner, token-aware, and extensible architecture. It creates a simplified process for developers and data engineers alike.


# Features
‚úÖ Full SFMC API Support (SOAP & REST based on official WSDL/docs)

üîê OAuth2 Token Management

- Auto-refresh
- Shared across SOAP & REST

üí¨ SOAP API Methods

- retrieve, create, update, delete, describe
- Supports MoreDataAvailable continuation

üåê REST API Methods

- get, post, put, patch, delete
Supports pagination using $page, $pagesize, and filtering

üìÅ Asset Copy Utility

- Copy content assets between folders: copy(source_folder, destination_folder, type)

‚öôÔ∏è Environment-Driven Configuration

- Fallback to environment variables if config dict not provided

üß© Built for Integration

- Gives you access to the entire SFMC API feature set defined by the official documentation without compromise 

üèóÔ∏è Data Engineering Ready
- Built for integration with data pipelines and data warehouse systems, regardless of the type of dataset in SFMC.

ü™µ Debug Logging

- Enable via SFMC_DEBUG=1 for verbose API call insight


üì¶ Environment-Based Config Support

You can initialize the client using a dict or via environment variables:
```bash
export SFMC_CLIENT_ID=your_id
export SFMC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
export SFMC_AUTH_URL=https://auth.exacttargetapis.com
export SFMC_REST_URL=https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.rest.marketingcloudapis.com
export SFMC_WSDL_URL=https://webservice.exacttarget.com/etframework.wsdl
export SFMC_SOAP_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.soap.marketingcloudapis.com
```
Optional: --config ./config.json

üîí Notes
Access tokens are shared between REST and SOAP.
The client auto-refreshes expired tokens.
Uses lxml.etree.Element to inject the OAuth token into SOAP headers.

# Example Usage
```python
from et_client_zeep import ET_Client

client = ET_Client()

# REST GET with pagination
assets = client.get(
    "asset/v1/content/assets",
    parameters={
        '$page': '1',
        '$pagesize': '100',
        '$filter': 'assetType.name=templatebasedemail'
    },
    morerow=True
)

# SOAP Retrieve
results = client.retrieve(
    object_type="DataExtensionObject[My_DE_Key]",
    properties=["Email", "SubscriberKey"],
    morerow=True
)
```

üêû Enabling debugging
Enable detailed logs by setting:

```bash
export SFMC_DEBUG=1 Or add this manually:
```

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

# Fetch Utility (fetch.py)

Export SFMC objects into CSVs for backup or auditing.

- Content Builder Assets (REST)
- Data Folders (SOAP)
- Data Extensions (SOAP)

Extendable to other SOAP objects via catalog

Usage:

# Fetch assets
```bash
python et_fetch.py --objectname assets
```

# Fetch DataExtensions with debug logging
```bash
python et_fetch.py --objectname DataExtension --debug
```

# Copy Utility (copy.py)

Copy or migrate SFMC objects between folders. Refere to the catalogs for the objectname (sfmc_soap_objects.json, sfmc_rest_objects.json)

Copy assets between folders
```bash
python et_copy.py --objectname listContentAssets --source-folder 123 --target-folder 456
```

# Copy DataExtensions
```bash
python et_copy.py --objectname DataExtension --source-folder 111 --target-folder 222
```

# SFMC Automation & SQL Graph
Interactive visualization tool built with Cytoscape.js that maps Salesforce Marketing Cloud entities ‚Äî Automations, Automation Activities, and QueryDefinitions.
It displays relationships between automations, SQL activities, and source/target data extensions with different modes, with features like:

- Dynamic graph layout showing entity connections
- Multi-select filter for focusing on specific automations
- Clickable query nodes to view SQL text
- Legend for easy identification of entity types
- Auto re-centering and zoom controls for smooth navigation

Extract and Build
```bash
python et_build.py --conf xyz
```
