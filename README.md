ET_Client is a lightweight, Python-based client library for interacting with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) SOAP and REST APIs. This library is built with modern tools like zeep for SOAP and requests for REST, replacing legacy FuelSDK implementations with a cleaner, token-aware, and extensible architecture.
